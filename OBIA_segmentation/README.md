# OBIA Solar Panel Segmentation

This repository demonstrates an **object-based image analysis (OBIA)** workflow using the open-source [NickySpatial](https://github.com/kshitijrajsharma/nickyspatial) library, combined with a simple web interface for training data collection and classification.

# Project Phases

## Phase 1 
- Focused on **solar panel detection** from UAV orthophotos in jupyter notebook
- Implemented segmentation with NickySpatial (Rule Based and Supervised)
- Added custom indices to improve feature separation for Rule Based. 
- Built a simple web UI for **sample collection**  
- Ran supervised classification using Random Forest, SVM, and KNN  
- Produced classified GeoJSON outputs for visualization
- Note: phase 1 is included in this repo. Since, the phase 2 now is more comprehensive, directly watching phase 2 video added below in phase 2 section will give the full overview. 

The solar panel segmentation use case was tested and the overall process and the results of the each steps are deteiled in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wnRmiJQ-FqkLDHre-ad9jihaWg1--8M0uIzdadruPw8/edit?usp=sharing 

## Phase 2
- Extends the workflow into a **general OBIA framework**  
- Supports **any segmentation + supervised classification task** (not limited to solar panels)  
- Unified interface for segmentation, sample labeling, and classification for any images (Satellite / drone)
- Uses Random Forest, SVM, and KNN as the main supervised classifiers  
- Goal: a reusable tool for object-based segmentation and classification workflows across domains
  
Note: phase2 is in different repo (https://github.com/geomatupen/obia). Visit this repo for further information of generic OBIA workflow for nickyspatial.

# OBIA Solar Panel Segmentation (Phase 1)

This project demonstrates an **object-based image analysis (OBIA)** workflow for detecting solar panels from drone orthophotos using the open-source [NickySpatial](https://github.com/nickyspatial) library.  
It includes segmentation, feature/indices extraction, sample collection through a simple UI, and supervised classification.

---

# What this repo includes
- Jupyter notebook (`obia_solar_segmentation.ipynb`) with the workflow  
- A simple **web UI** (`index.html`, `main.js`) to pick training samples and export them as `samples.json`  
- Example outputs (segmented and classified GeoJSONs)  
- `environment.yaml` for easy environment setup with conda  

---

# Getting started

## 1. Setup environment
Using the provided conda environment file:

    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate obia

Or install manually (Python 3.9+ recommended):

    pip install nickyspatial
    pip install geopandas rasterio shapely fiona pyproj
    pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas tqdm jupyter

## 2. Run notebooks
Open the Jupyter notebook (`obia_solar_segmentation.ipynb`) and run the cells step by step.

This covers:
- Loading and (optionally) downsampling the orthophoto  
- Running segmentation with parameters such as `scale` and `compactness`  
- Adding custom indices (e.g., `(G - R) / (G + R)`)  
- Exporting segments to GeoJSON  

## 3. Collect training samples
- Open `webui/index.html` in a browser  
- Load the segment GeoJSON  
- Assign segments to classes (e.g., *Solar* / *Non-Solar*)  
- Download labeled samples as `samples.json`
- paste the samples.json inside the results folder

## 4. Classification
Train supervised models (Random Forest, SVM, KNN) using the labeled samples.  
- Random Forest generally performed best  
- KNN worked moderately well  
- SVM may need more training samples to perform well  

Classified outputs are saved as GeoJSON files for visualization.

# Results
- Segmentation and classification outputs are stored as GeoJSON files  
- Random Forest provides a good baseline for solar panel detection  
- Results improved with more and better-balanced training samples
